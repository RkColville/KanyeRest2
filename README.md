Okay, so this is what this program is all about!
Created this project with my bootcamp. 
This project pulls quotes from https://api.kanye.rest and https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes via API calls using the Newtonsoft.JSON NuGet package. 
The program will “chat” using a loop to simulate the two talking back and forth until the loop finishes execution.
